# Bike Rental Analysis

This Streamlit application visualizes bike rental data based on seasons and weekdays. The application answers two key questions:
1. **What is the relationship between seasons and the number of bikes rented?**
2. **What is the relationship between weekdays and the number of bikes rented?**

## Features

- **Season Analysis**: Displays the total number of bikes rented based on the season (Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall).
- **Weekday Analysis**: Displays the total number of bikes rented based on weekdays (Monday to Sunday).
- **Visualizations**: Bar plots, line plots, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize the relationship between the features and bike rentals.
